### Howard Durdle

My background is information security in defence and finance, but I've worked at every level of the tech stack from bare metal systems and networking, through IT management, software development and C-level positions. Professionally I now work with SMEs to improve their security posture and enhance their IT and Software Development functions. As a hobbyist, I spend time with home automation and electronics - such as the ESP 8266 and related chips.  Most of my GitHub stuff is work that integrates with systems like  [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) and [Magic Mirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) to do useful things like [track where my cats are](https://cats.durdle.com).
